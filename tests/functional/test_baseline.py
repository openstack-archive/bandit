    This set of tests is used to verify that the baseline comparison handles
    finding and comparing results appropriately. The only comparison is the
    number of candidates per file, meaning that any candidates found may
    already exist in the baseline. In this case, all candidates are flagged
    and a user will need to investigate the candidates related to that file.

        of the baseline report can be extremely dynamic and difficult to create
