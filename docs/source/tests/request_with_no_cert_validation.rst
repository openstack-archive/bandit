request_with_no_cert_validation
==============================================

Description
-----------
Encryption in general is typically critical to the security of an application.  Using TLS can greatly increase security by guaranteeing the identity of the party you are communicating with.  This is accomplished by one or both parties presenting trusted certificates during the connection initialization phase of TLS.

When request methods are used certificates are validated automatically which is the desired behavior.  If certificate validation is explicitly turned off Bandit will return a HIGH severity error.

Available Since

 - Bandit v0.9.0
