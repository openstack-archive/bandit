blacklist_imports
=================

Description
-----------
A number of Python modules and known to provide collections of functionality
with potential security implications. The blacklist imports plugin test is
designed to detect the use of these modules by scanning code for `import`
statements and checking for the imported modules presence in a configurable
blacklist. The imported modules are fully qualified and de-aliased prior to
checking. To illustrate this, imagine a check for "module.evil" running on the
following example code:

.. code-block:: python

    import module                    # no warning
    import module.evil               # warning
    from module import evil          # warning
    from module import evil as good  # warning

This would generate a warning about importing `module.evil` in each of the last
three cases, despite the module being aliased as `good` in one of them. It would
also not generate a warning on the first import (of `module`) as it's fully
qualified name will not match.

Each of the provided blacklisted modules can be grouped such that they generate
appropriate warnings (message, severity) and a token `{module}` may be used
in the provided output message, to be replaced with the actual module name.

Due to the nature of the test, confidence is always reported as HIGH
