paramiko_calls
==============

Description
-----------
Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for secure
(encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It is intended to
run commands on a remote host. These commands are run within a shell on the
target and are thus vulnerable to various shell injection attacks. Bandit
reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use of Paramiko's "exec_command" or
"invoke_shell" methods advising the user to check inputs are correctly
sanitized.

Available Since

 - Bandit v0.12.0
