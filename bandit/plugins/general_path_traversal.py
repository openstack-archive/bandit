B112: Test for os.path.join with variables
===================================================

Using os.path.join to combine variable into a single file path can lead to
unintended directory traversal if the variables invovled can be manipulated:

.. code-block: python

    local = read_input() # set to somthing like "../../../"
    path = os.path.join(local, "etc") # system level etc not local

**Config Options:**
None

:Example:

.. code-block: none

    >> Issue: Check variables used with os.path.join are trusted or sanitised.
       Severity: Low   Confidence: Low
       Location: ./examples/os_path_join.py:2
    1 f = os.path.join(local, "etc")
    2 f.write('blah')

.. seealso::

.. versionadded:: 1.0
